# I0 has the value of 0.3763210604753777. Since this value was used to calculate the 
# confidence intervals in the questions, the confidence intervals can tell us whether I0 will
# be included in the specified ranged in the question.
# For [I1-3d1, I1+3d1], results show confidence interval of 0.9480. Therefore this shows that I0 is within the range ~94.8% of the time.
# Likewise, for [I2-3d2, I2+3d2], results show confidence interval of 0.997. This shows that I0 is whitin the range ~99.7% of the time.
# For [I3-3d3, I3+3d3], results show confidence interval of 0.815. This shows that I0 is whitin the range ~81.5% of the time.
